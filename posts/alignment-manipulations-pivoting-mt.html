This post is an account of the implementation of the pivoting feature - traversing math I’m to date still not certain of, hacking one thing after another together effectively engineering a feature shipped and running in about <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/">300k installations</a> now.</p>
<p>The idea is simple - given a source language <span class="math inline">\(ss\)</span> translate to a target language <span class="math inline">\(tt\)</span>, through a pivot language <span class="math inline">\(pp\)</span>. Given how history put us in an <em>anglocentric</em> position, there happens to be a lot of parallel-data between English and other languages of the world, than between other pairs. Sentence aligned parallel data aligned drives machine-translation and this consequently meant the existence of a lot of <span class="math inline">\(ss \rightarrow en\)</span> models and <span class="math inline">\(en \rightarrow tt\)</span> models. Consequently pivoting through English to obtain <span class="math inline">\(ss \rightarrow tt\)</span> remains a prevalent strategy in the field of machine-translation. At the time, the Bergamot Project stood in agreement with its model inventory.</p>
<p>The text part of pivoting is straight-forward. However, one critical-piece to keeping a user-facing HTML translation feature functional was obtaining alignments between the source and target properly. Critical, because the HTML translation feature relied on working alignment information to place tags correctly when matching-tokens in source and target moved around. HTML translation feature was ready with vanilla-translation without pivoting and using alignments. For the pivoting case, attention matrices providing alignments for source to pivot and pivot to target was available separately.</p>
<p>Using these to obtain source to target alignments wasn’t straightforward (at least to me, back then). So I’ve decided this warrants a post, albeit a bit late.</p>
<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>
<!--
@luong2015effective formulates attention as follows:

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{a} &= \mathrm{align}(\mathbf{h}_t, \mathbf{h}_s) \\
               &= \dfrac
                                {\exp \left(\mathrm{score}\left(\mathbf{h}_t, \mathbf{h}_s\right)\right)}
                                {\sum_{s'}{\exp\left(\mathrm{score}\left(\mathbf{h}_t, \mathbf{h}_s'\right)\right)}}

<p>Marian, the library bergamot-translator is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev/blob/c29cc83dc4d234f0e3a00a46a729053132b408b8/src/models/costs.h#L86">uses</a> an additional loss formulated using attention to additionally learn <em>alignments</em> between source and target tokens. During training, a guided alignment loss is added to the objective that uses alignment information as a training signal. A tool matching tokens in source to tokens in target from raw-corpus like <a href="https://github.com/clab/fast_align">fastalign</a> can provide alignments that can be used as ground-truths. At inference, the attention values will predict the expected alignments. Note that this is different from learning to align, the network is forced to learn to align to certain ground truths from alignment data here. More on this process can be found in <span class="citation">Chen et al. (<a href="#ref-chen2016guided">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Illustrations visualizing attention are often attached as qualitative samples demonstrating attention’s efficacy. The render below comes from something <a href="https://github.com/jerinphilip/bergamot-translator/pull/88">I repurposed</a> with borrowed source from <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/augmented-rnns/">distill.pub</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Translating German to English: Alignments via attention</p>
</div>
<p>The above illustration also provide hints to underlying data, and data-structures. The initiated should immediately recognize the tokens (on source and target) can be modelled as nodes and the arrows modelled as weighted edges between source and target tokens.</p>
<p>In code, we have an adjacency-matrix describing the probabilities / scores matching a source-token with a target-token.</p>
<h2 id="pivoting">Pivoting</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the idea is simple - given a source language <span class="math inline">\(ss\)</span> translate to a target language <span class="math inline">\(tt\)</span>, through a pivot language <span class="math inline">\(pp\)</span>. To get a hang of the elements involved in a translation from German to Italian via English as pivot, see illustrations below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../static/images/pivoting-de-en.png" alt="German to English" />
<p class="caption">German to English</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../static/images/pivoting-en-it.png" alt="English to Italian" />
<p class="caption">English to Italian</p>
</div>
<p>We have two adjacency matrices in-play here, one with scores for source-pivot pair and the other with scores for pivot-target pair. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll first try to come up with a formulation and algorithm for the case when the pivot tokens match (<em>i.e</em> same vocabulary) and matrix multiplication is straighforward.</p>
<h3 id="same-vocabulary">Same vocabulary</h3>
<p>Let the tokens involved in pivoting be <span class="math inline">\(S, P, T\)</span> denoting source, pivot and target respectively.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    S = \{s_i\} &amp;= \{s_1, s_2, \dots \} \\
    P = \{q_j\} &amp;= \{q_1, q_2, \dots \} \\
    T = \{t_k\} &amp;= \{t_1, t_2, \dots \} 
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>These tokens do not necessarily correspond to the notion of <em>words</em>. Note that I am using <span class="math inline">\(q_j\)</span> to represent the pivot sequence <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> so as to not confuse with probabilities used in this document, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span>.</p>
<p>From alignments coming out of the decoding pipeline, we obtain a probability for each source-token <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> over the target token <span class="math inline">\(t_j\)</span>. We will use <span class="math inline">\(p(s_i | t_j)\)</span> to denote this in this post. For each target-token <span class="math inline">\(t_j\)</span> we have a probability distribution spread over source-tokens <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know the values <span class="math inline">\(p(s_i | q_j)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(q_j | t_k)\)</span> at inference as some form of attention/alignment from the constituent neural network. I will cook up the math below to get the required <span class="math inline">\(p(s_i | t_k)\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(s_i | t_k)  &amp;= \sum_{j}{p(s_i, q_j| t_k)}  \label{eq:marginalize-pivot} &amp; \text{Marginalization(?)}  \\
              &amp;= \sum_{j}{{p(s_i| q_j,  t_k) \cdot p(q_i | t_k) }}        &amp; \text{Bayes rule(?)}       \\
p(s_i | t_k)  &amp;= \sum_{j}{{p(s_i | q_j)\cdot p(q_j | t_k) }}              &amp; \text{Independence(?)}
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>In an ideal case, if we assume the pivot tokens constituting the pivot sentence are same, we have a <span class="math inline">\(|S| \times |P|\)</span> matrix and a <span class="math inline">\(|P| \times |T|\)</span> matrix. The above formulation in implementation translates to a matrix multiplication, of matrices containing attention values coming out of the source to pivot and pivot to target translation processes. Not sure if the above math is sound, I’m mostly working backwards from a gut feeling that I have two attention matrices, multiplying them should give me the required probabilities.</p>
<p>This matrix-multiplication is implemented in bergamot-translator <a href="https://github.com/jerinphilip/bergamot-translator/blob/4fed75af1deb3ede67d9ade0354b87b0806a0ad3/src/translator/response.cpp#L127-L137">here</a>. The implementation makes an additional hop, due to the vocabularies being different. We will discuss this in detail next.</p>
<h3 id="different-vocabularies">Different vocabularies</h3>
<p>In reality, it’s not as simple as above. Due to historical reasons, the <span class="math inline">\(ss \rightarrow pp\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(pp \rightarrow tt\)</span> models happen to be be using different sets of vocabularies. If we take a closer look at the diagrams above, we see <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P'\)</span> are different. See an extract below. The tokens are space separated.</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode">
<code class="sourceCode">[S ] Der heutige Artikel in Wikipedia , der freie En zy klo pä die .
[P ] To day ' s article in Wikipedia , the free en cycl o pedia .
[P'] Today ' s article in Wikipedia , the free e ncy clo pedia .
[T ] L ' articolo di oggi su Wikipedia , l ' en ciclo pedia libera .</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The previous formulation was convenient in our application of NMT case when the vocabulary used to represent the language <span class="math inline">\(pp\)</span> is consistent giving us <span class="math inline">\(S \leftarrow P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P \leftarrow T\)</span>. To obtain the probabilities in the inconsistent case, we can use the knowledge that vocabularies match at character or byte level. Both vocabularies describe the same underlying text-surface.</p>
<p>Updating the formulation to include inconsistent pivot vocabularies, we get:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    S  = \{s_i    \} &amp;= \{s_1, s_2, \dots   \}    \\
    P  = \{q_j    \} &amp;= \{q_1, q_2, \dots   \}    \\
    P' = \{q'_{j'}\} &amp;= \{q'_1, q'_2, \dots \}    \\
    T  = \{t_k    \} &amp;= \{t_1, t_2, \dots   \}    \\
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>The old math remains valid, but requires some reinterpretation. We will start from the formulation we already have.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(s_i | t_k)  &amp;= \sum_{j}{{p(s_i | q_j)\cdot p(q_j | t_k) }}  \\
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>Both <span class="math inline">\(q'_{j'}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_j\)</span> describe a surface in the same underlying string, which overlaps to some extent. We can use this information to proportionately assign probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(q'_{j'}\)</span> to the characters, and reinterpret them in terms of <span class="math inline">\(q_j\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    p(q_j | t_j) &amp;= \sum_{q'_{j'}}{\mathrm{overlap}(q_j, q'_{j'}) \cdot  p(q'_{j'} | t_j)} \\
    \mathrm{overlap}(q_j, q'_{j'}) &amp;= \dfrac{\lvert q_j \cap q'_{j'} \rvert}{\lvert q'_{j'} \rvert} \\
\end{align*}\]</span>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>I have cooked up a lot of math, now how do I validate it? Thankfully this is grounded in a real use-case. I can try and do German to English to Italian, but the weird thing is I don’t speak/read the source and target languages. I came up with the not-so-standard but useful use-case of translating English to Estonian to English doing the round-trip.</p>
<p>The above process is textbook definition of <em>lost in translation</em>. When translating through an intermediate language, some information is lost (or added). Some corruption to the tokens happen. However, should the alignment formulations and engineering be sound the scores should correspond for the tokens surviving <em>lost in translation</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with the above, I filtered out the top-scores and printed them on the console during development. Find some output from the time of development below (click to expand).</p>

<p>Turns out, the tokens match most of the time strong when they’re same. The implementation works as intended!</p>
<p>The implementation of the above reinterpretation for vocabulary mismatch is available <a href="https://github.com/jerinphilip/bergamot-translator/blob/4fed75af1deb3ede67d9ade0354b87b0806a0ad3/src/translator/response.cpp#L13-L97">here</a>. This code in action, through the alignments visualization pipeline I get the following render:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../static/images/pivoting-de-it.png" alt="German to Italian: alignments after corrections following pivoting." />
<p class="caption">German to Italian: alignments after corrections following pivoting.</p>
</div>
<p>Arrows appear to be pointing in the right direction as well. <em>libera</em> corresponds to <em>freie</em> - this is one case where corresponding tokens have moved around to a different position in translation. The force looks strong between the nodes in the cluster forming <em>enciclopedia</em> and <em>Enzyklopädie</em>. <em>Artikel</em> and <em>articolo</em>, <em>Wikipedia</em> and <em>Wikipedia</em> looks strong as well.</p>
<p>The test-in-the wild for this piece of code is transferring links and formatting in inline-text.
